# Credit Risk Classification

### Purpose of the analysis:
 
 The purpose of this analysis was to use historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can predict whether a loan will be healthy or high-risk.

### Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict:
The data used to make the model included over 77,000 data points containing the following 7 features:
- Loan size
- Interest rate
- Borrower's yearly income
- Borrower's debt to income Ratio
- Borrower's number of accounts
- Borrower's derogatory marks
- Borrower's total debt

Using these features, the model can predict if a loan will be healthy or high-risk. The model would help the lender adjust the loan size and interest rate offered with the goal of predicting a healthy loan. For example, if a potential borrower wanted a $15,000 loan but the model always predicted this to be high-risk, then the lender would deny that loan. If lowering the amount to $10,000 resulted in a prediction of healthy, then the lender could instead offer a $10,000 loan, rather than completely denying the loan service. A good model will lower the amount of defaulted loans the lender gets.

### Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis:
First, the dataset was randomly split into training and testing datasets. The training dataset contained 75% of the original data, the testing dataset contained the remaining 75% of the original data.

Then, a Logistic Regression model was treated using the training data and the LogisticRegression function from sklear.linear_model.

The testing data was then applied to this model to make predictions on the loan's status.

The model's performace was evaluated using three functions from skliearn.metrics: calculating its balanced accuracy score, generating a confusion matrix, and printing a classification report.


### Results:

- Accurracy:
- Precision:
- Recall

### Summary:

Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning. (10 points)
